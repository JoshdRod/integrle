# Integrle - A wordle clone for integrals!
Give a man an integral, he'll solve it for a day.

Teach a man to integrate, he'll be solving for the rest of his life.

One integral. Every day. With instant feedback and video walkthroughs*.

<sup>* Instant feedback and video walkthroughs coming soon</sup>

## Current Progress

At Integrle HQ (my bedroom), we've been working hard to create a mathematical expression evaluation engine that's good enough to handle the majority of things the average mathematician would want to put in.

✔️ Expressions with commutative operators are treated as equal even if their operands are different sides of the operator.

🔧 Expressions which are divided by a number, n, are treated as equal to the expression times 1/number.

🔜 Make the integral change daily!
